Database for "A global database for climate-related financial policies"


<bold>.BACKGROUND<\bold>.

Climate change can directly impact financial stability by increasing the frequency and severity of natural disasters like heat waves, windstorms, floods, or droughts. Physical risks can reduce the value of financial organizations' collateral assets and insurance liabilities when they manifest. Transition risks, such as unforeseen adjustments in climate policy, technological advancement, or shifts in public opinion and consumers' preferences, can also impact financial markets. Therefore, it is now commonly accepted that central banks and financial regulators must act to establish regulations to address climate-related financial risks and scale up green finance. Although their policies cannot substitute for climate policy, central banks' and financial regulators' actions are essential for addressing current and future climate threats to financial stability. 


OBJECTIVE OF THE PROJECT

Our knowledge of what policies are used across countries and time, which the authorities responsible for their promotion and implementation, and the “bindingness” of the policy is still quite limited, hindering our ability to understand the newly developed financial policies and institutions’ reforms in the short and medium run in response to climate change threats to the financial system stability. Against this backdrop, this article introduces the Climate-related Financial Policies Database and provides statistics on its main indicators. The database captures various aspects of financial (central banks and financial regulators and supervisors) and non-financial (ministries, banking associations, governments, and others) institutions’ green financial policymaking in the past 20 years.

METHODOLOGY 

The methodology is described in D'Orazio, P. (2022), A global database for climate-related financial policies, under review

DATA SOURCES

A wide range of public sources is used to populate, update and curate the dataset, including official government, central banks and financial institutions sources, webpages of public institutions, central banks, financial supervisory authorities, governments, and banking associations.
An Open Library of Sources contains all sources used to collect the data.

GEO: geographical location according to the World Bank classification.
DEV: Development stage according to the World Bank classification:
- high-income countries: HIC, 
- upper-middle income countries: UMIC, 
- lower-middle-income countries: UMIC, 
- low-income countries: LIC.

YEAR: Year of adoption of the policy.
CAT1: Type of instrument: for each category, single instruments have been recorded. 
CAT2: Taxonomy according to the five Policy Areas. 
DESCR: Describes the measure found in the text data source, translated into English.
AUTH: Identifies the institution responsible for the promotion/implementation of the policy, as mentioned in the document. 
AUTHCAT: Identifies the type of institution responsible for the promotion/implementation of the policy classified according to the following categories:
